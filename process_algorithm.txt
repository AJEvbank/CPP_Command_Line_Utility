Problem:

Given: A set of rules contained in an ArgumentRule, an integer (argc), and a
sequence of strings (argv).

Do: Create a sequence of valid arguments of type Argument. If an invalid
argument is encountered throw an appropriate error.

Definitions:

  rule scope - The current rule scope is the current rule under which an
               argument is being examined.

General -
1. If the rule scope has any required values, enqueue each value after
   validating it. If a value is invalid, throw an error. If there are insuffi-
   cient arguments to fill the required values, throw an error. Test arguments
   under this rule for only the specific number of required arguments.
2. If the rule scope has any optional values, test each argument and if the
   argument is not an option and is valid, enqueue the argument, else throw an
   error. If the argument is an option, begin step 3. Test arguments under this
   rule for only the specific number of optional arguments.
3. If the rule scope has one or more options, test each argument to see if it
   is valid under the rule scope. If it is, add it to the option set. If it is
   not, throw an error. If the argument is not an option, throw an error. Test
   only as many arguments as there are options in the current rule scope. When
   all options have been added to the option set, return.

There should be an argument tree on the sequence for every value or primary
(top-level) option on the command line. The rule scope can be qualified by
testing the name of the ArgumentRule. "__Rules__" is reserved.

There are two separate algorithms for processing the command line. There is a
top level wrapper function for the CommLineOps class that calls the recursive
function for the ArgumentRule class.
